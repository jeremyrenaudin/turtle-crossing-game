# Turtle Crossing Game
In this game, you will take on the role of a turtle (not a ninja one unfortunately). Your goal is to make your way through the cars and cross the road safely.

## How did I break this project down?
I split up this development into 5 steps:

1. Move the turtle with keypress
2. Create random cars and make them move
3. Detect a collision with a car
4. Detect when the turtle reaches the other side
5. Create a scoreboard
6. Increase cars' speed at each new level

## Files
- `main.py`: application that runs the game
- `player.py`: package to model the turtle
- `car_manager.py`: package to generate the random cars
- `scoreboard.py`: package to initialize a scoreboard

## Key to play
Simply use the Up arrow key.
